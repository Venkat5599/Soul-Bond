## Questions Judges Might Ask:

**Q: Why blockchain?**
A: Permanent, verifiable, decentralized proof that can't be altered

**Q: Why non-transferable?**
A: Real relationships aren't commodities. This preserves sentimental value.

**Q: What's next?**
A: Expand to credentials, achievements, memberships - any non-transferable proof

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: Freemium model - basic free, premium features (custom designs, etc.)

**Q: What if people break up?**
A: The NFT stays as a historical record, like a photo. Can add "archive" feature.

## Good Luck! 🍀

Remember:
- Confidence is key
- Tell a story, don't just show features
- Emphasize the "why" not just the "what"
- Have fun with it!
